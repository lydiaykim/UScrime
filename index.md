title: Predicting and Preventing Murder in the U.S.
---



## Research questions
1. What are the most important predictors of reductions in murder rates in Metropolitan areas of the US between 2006 and 2016? 
1. From among these, which are the most important policy measures that law enforcement officials can adopt to reduce murder rates? 


## Background
The goal of this project is to shed light on the areas of the country experiencing the highest rates of murder and violence. 

Overall, murder rates in the US rose in 2016 and 2017 for the first time since 2006 (Williams 2017). President Trump has made addressing rising crime and murder rates as a key policy priority in his administration. Pledging that his administration would put a stop to this ?American carnage? (White House, 2017). 

Popular and policy journalists writing at the time of the inauguration pointed out that he crime figures Trump was raising alarm bells about may have been misleading. The overall rise in crime was in fact driven by a few outliers among the metropolitan areas of the country with increasing rates of violence such as Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington DC (McCray, 2017). 

Identifying the causes of changes ? whether positive reductions in homicides or the more troubling increases we have seen in some areas in the last two years ? is a key policy question for law enforcement officials. Our project will use a variety of publicly available data sources to identify predictors of increases and decreases in crime rates across metropolitan areas in the US.  

Since crime has been falling in most areas over the last decade, we will focus on identifying predictors of decreases in the murder rate, rather than the predictors of the outlier increases of the last two years.

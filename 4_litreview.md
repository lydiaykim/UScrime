Before beginning our analysis we prepared to select predictor variables and models. We conducted a literature review to inform our selection of predictors. We used the findings from this literature reivew to choose which variables to explore in our EDA. Based on the joint findings of these two exercises we chose the variables to include in our models. Additionally, we constructed a matrix of possible models and their respective strengths and weaknesses to inform our model selection. 

## Predictor selection

We based the variables we chose on a careful review of the literature on causes of crime and murders. The findings of our literaure, and predictors that we included in our models as a result of each finding review are summarized in the table below.  

**Census variables**
The first section of the table includes reviews predictors found in the census which the liturature review indicated would be useful to include. Variables that measured each of these were taken directly from data sets available from the US Census Bureau for every state in every relevant year. 

**Other variables**
The second section reviews other variables which the liturature reivew indicated would be useful. 

Of the three predictors of interest we identified, outside of the census data, we were only able to usable data for access to firearms. For this we used a dataset from the State Firearms Law Project, which documents all possible types of gun control legislation and  assigns a binary variable of or 0 or 1 to every state in every year based on whether the law was active in that state at that time.

| Population by Race                                                      | Minority populations tend to have higher contribution to crime rates. Additionally, in previous research non-white young population has been used to analyze crime trends to account for demographic change. Other studies have used this information to account for differences in culture.                                                                                                                                 | Blumstein and Rosenfeld (1998), Ehlrich (1979)                                                                      |
| Population by Gender                                                    | Looking murder rate statistics, we can see that male population has a higher contribution to crime rates.  Additionally, it helps to factor demographic characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Blumstein and Rosenfeld (1998)                                                                                      |
| Age dependency ratio,  Old age dependency ratio, Child dependency ratio | These variables help describe the demographics as it relates to population in economic active ages with the rest of the population. As mentioned above population demographics are an important factor on crime statistics. In particular, a increase on dependency can strain economic resources within households. Moreover, as mentioned before, youth population high representation in crime rates.                     | Blumstein and Rosenfeld (1998), Ehlrich (1979), Deming (2009), Kling, Ludwig, Katz (2005), Lochner, Moretti  (2003) |

| Disability Status, Citizenship Status                                   | These variables help describe the population demographics. They might be relevant because these populations are group minorities that may have difficulties to find jobs, be in a high risk of poverty and may be less well integrated to the rest of the community                                                                                                                                                          | Blumstein and Rosenfeld (1998)                                                                                      |

Changing opportunities of economic activity can be an essential factor for crime reduction. Information of employment, particularly for young male population is relevant and commonly used in empirical analysis of crime.                                                                                            | Elrich (1979)                                                                                                       |

Areas that host industries with higher income can deter incentives of crime.                                                                                                                                                               | Cornwell, Trumbull (1994)                                                                                           |
| Income and Poverty Status                                               | Lower income population has higher contribution to crime rates. Additionally, recent research has found links between income distribution, and in particular inequality, and crime.  Poverty has a strong relationship with crime and, particularly, murder.  Populations with higher poverty rates tend to have a higher level of crime and members of this population group have a strong presence in incarceration rates. | Fajnzylber, Lederman, Loayza (2002)                                                                                 |

## Model selection

Our project has two goals. The first is to develop a model that can predict the murder rate, and the second is to develop a model that can predict if the murder rate in a given metropolitan area will fall in the next year. The first question requires a continous predction model and the second a categorical prediction model. 

To inform our thinking and prepare for our analysis we first reviewed the prediction models that we might want to use, and considered their strengths and weaknesses in our context. We did this seperately for continuous and categorical prediction in the two tables below.

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OLS                | Straight forward to understand and explain to policy makers. Allows for easy interpretation of significance of coefficients. | Dimensionality canât be reduces. Likely so suffer from over fitting in our case when we have so many variables.                                                |
| Stepwise selection | Allows for easy interpretation of significance of coefficients. Reduces dimensionality.                                      | Difficult procedure to explain to policy makers. Produces models with less explanatory power.                                                                  |
| Ridge              | Produces models with high predictive power.                                                                                  | Difficult procedure to explain to policy makers. Does not perform model selection or variable selection. Difficult to interpret coefficients and significance. |
| Lasso              | Produces models with high predictive power. Performs model selection and reduces dimensionality of problem.                  | Difficult procedure to explain to policy makers. Difficult to interpret coefficients and significance.                                                         |
| K-NN               | Does not impose linearity on data, allows for greatest possible degree of flexibility in modeling.                           | Difficult procedure to explain to policy makers. Does not perform model selection or variable selection. Difficult to interpret coefficients and significance. |

### Categorical models matrix

| Logistic Model                 | It is easy to understand and has high predictive power. Allows for easy interpretation of significance of coefficients.  We can observe probabilities associated with each observation.                                                                                               | Doesnât perform well when feature space is too large. Doesnât handle large number of categorical features/variables well.                 |
| LDA/ QDA                       | Decision boundary are usually not complex. Not very demanding in memory. If number of features is small and the distribution of the predictors is approximately normal in each of the classes, the linear discriminant model is again more stable than the logistic regression model. | Hard to interpret. Makes a lot of assumptions. Quite sensitive to outliers.                                                               |
| Decision Trees/ Random Forests | Models obtained from decision tree are intuitive and easy to explain. Can handle non-linear features. The problem of over-fitting is overcome to large extent by using Random Forests,                                                                                                | Probability scores are not a direct result., Can over fit the training set.                                                               |
| SVM                            | Performs well with large number of features, non-linear interactions and does not rely on the entire data. Has a regularization parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting.                                                                                    | Not very efficient with large number of observations.Moves the problem of over-fitting from optimizing the parameters to model selection. |
